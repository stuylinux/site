Plenty of programmers use Linux because it's super simple to set up tooling for pretty much any programming language you'd need!

We'll look at getting set up with a few common languages.

# C(++)

## Installing libraries
Getting set up with libraries is a bit unintuitive for a newcomer, but once you've tried it out, it'll be super simple, barely an inconvenience!

# Fortran

# Rust
cargo and rustup and stuff

# Go

# Nim

# Java

# JavaScript
There are a variety of runtimes out there, each with their own merits. Lenny knows more about this part so I'll probably have him write it...

# Elixir

# Racket

# Netlogo
