    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div id="content">
        <p>
            Stuy Linux is Stuyvesant's only initiative to promote the use of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) programs and
            the GNU/Linux projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            We work in collaboration with the
            <a href="https://www.stuycs.org/" target="_blank">Stuyvesant CS department</a>
            to host weekly meetings that provide students with an extracurricular space that encourages them to explore,
            investigate, and understand the inner workings of the software that runs the world around them. We host our own shared
            compute cluster on an Orange Pi with Linux Containers (LXD), allowing us to provide each member with their own personal
            root-access Alpine Linux environment for experiments with different tools. In addition, we host our own IRC server,
            <a href="https://irc.stuylinux.org" target="_blank">irc.stuylinux.org</a>
            bridged to a Gitter/Matrix channel (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#stuy-linux:gitter.im" target="_blank">#stuy-linux:gitter.im</a>) and a
            <a href="https://discord.gg/8pkfP7mU78" target="_blank">Discord server</a>
            to engage with our community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meetings revolve around collaborative exercises in real-life applications of software tools written in any language
            available, from C to Rust, Go to Python, or JavaScript to Java! After developing problem-solving skills with these
            technologies, we tackle
            <a href="https://picoctf.org" target="_blank">CMU picoCTF</a>
            challenges to emphasize how rewarding it can be to explore different avenues in the software and cybersecurity
            world.
