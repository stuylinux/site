        <h2>What is Stuy Linux</h2>
        <p>
            Stuy Linux is Stuyvesant's only initiative to promote the use of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) programs and
            the GNU/Linux projects.
        </p>
        <h3>What do we do?</h3>
        <p>
            We work in collaboration with the
            <a href="https://www.stuycs.org/" target="_blank">Stuyvesant CS department</a>
            to host weekly meetings that provide students with an extracurricular space that encourages them to explore,
            investigate, and understand the inner workings of the software that runs the world around them.
        </p>
        <h3>What are some things Stuy Linux does?</h3>
        <p>
            We host our own shared
            compute cluster on an Orange Pi with Linux Containers (LXD), allowing us to provide each member with their own personal
            root-access Alpine Linux environment for experiments with different tools. In addition, we host our own IRC server,
            <a href="https://irc.stuylinux.org" target="_blank">irc.stuylinux.org</a>
            bridged to a Gitter/Matrix channel (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#stuy-linux:gitter.im" target="_blank">#stuy-linux:gitter.im</a>) and a
            <a href="https://discord.gg/8pkfP7mU78" target="_blank">Discord server</a>
            to engage with our community.
        </p>
        <h3>What happens in a Stuy Linux Meeting</h3>
        <p>
            Meetings revolve around collaborative exercises in real-life applications of software tools written in any language
            available, from C to Rust, Go to Python, or JavaScript to Java! After developing problem-solving skills with these
            technologies, we tackle
            <a href="https://picoctf.org" target="_blank">CMU picoCTF</a>
            challenges to emphasize how rewarding it can be to explore different avenues in the software and cybersecurity
            world.

            <summary>expand for full club charter</summary>
            <h4>What is this club?</h4>
            <p>Stuy Linux is a beginner-friendly club that lets members explore Free/Libre Open Source Software (FOSS) that respects the user and their rights. We provide access to Linux server systems at our meetings, and invite everyone to check out the endless possibilities and freedoms available on Linux systems. Feel free to check out our blog, where we post writeups on interesting topics, and our chat server (also on Discord), where our community provides support and discussions on technology.</p>
            <h4>What days does this organization meet?</h4>
            <p>Friday</p>
            <h4>What is the meeting schedule?</h4>
            <p>We usually meet weekly or semi-weekly on Fridays, with hiatuses near exam seasons. We also host virtual holiday meetings, where we play online video games or watch a classic Sci-Fi movie, to foster connection within the Stuy Linux community. With the growth of the Stuy Linux team and our collective resources, we are considering expanding our meeting lineup to include bootcamp-style meetings where inexperienced members can receive direct instruction on practical programming skills, along with additional meetings covering things we are simply passionate about.</p>
            <h4>What would a typical meeting look like?</h4>
            <p>Thanks to partnerships with the CS department, we are able to hold meetings in CS labs with Linux desktops. Members are able to log into their personal Linux server container on our Orange Pi to run and install the programs they please. We aim to provide something more than an "11th period", both in terms of novelty/interest and duration, which is why most of our meetings revolve around projects we are passionate about, such as "capture the flag" (CTF) style puzzles for members to investigate and apply the technologies they have been exposed to. Topics have ranged from the strongest military-grade encryption to the humble text editor. These Friday evening meetings are usually rather relaxing, and we spend our time together socializing over the latest and greatest technology. We also aim to post writeups of our meetings to our website blog, where members can independently explore and extend upon the activities done during the meetings.</p>
            <h4>How does this activity appoint leaders?</h4>
            <p>Stuy Linux is primarily led by its 2 senior co-presidents, alongside 2 junior co-presidents who are training to gain the experience needed to lead the club. Leaders are expected to host meetings, maintain Stuy Linux infrastructure/services, and write blog posts to enrich the Stuy Linux archives. In addition, officers for specific non-technical roles, such as Treasurer and Social Media Manager, may be enlisted for their experience in fields unrelated to the club's core focus.</p>
            <h4>What makes this activity unique?</h4>
            <p>Stuyvesant High School has a rich ecosystem of computer science/programming clubs, but no active clubs expressly emphasize and embrace Free/Libre Open Source Software. Unlike many of the school's other clubs, Stuy Linux aims for a language-agnostic approach to its content instead of focusing on a specific programming language. In addition, Stuy Linux was founded in response to a narrowly-scoped and inactive Cybersecurity club that existed in 2022, serving as an active and competitive alternative to resume-padding clubs. Stuy Linux also discusses the intricacies Unix-like systems beyond GNU/Linux, such as the BSD and its derivatives, like the XNU kernel and its commonly-known implementations in the MacOS and iOS, along with the Linux kernel's significant applications in Android, ChromeOS, and others. Our community is noteworthy for its online nature, which allows us to remain connected to interested individuals and alumni who remain interested in FOSS topics. These features were not within the scope of Stuyvesant communities that existed at the time of Stuy Linux's inception, and remain distinguishing aspects of the club to this day.</p>
